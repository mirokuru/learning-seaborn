# learning-seaborn
A learning project from SuperDataScience's Python A-Z course for learning Python for data science.
The project involves reproducing a data visualization based on an image using Python.

The code involves:
- reading a csv file where you first need to find out the encoding used
- filtering the data with multiple values from different fields
- using Seaborn to overlay two plots over each other: a boxplot and a stripplot
- configuring chart style, colors, labels, etc
